⚠️ This package is under review


### What can this package do for you?
The `quadkeyr` R package presents a comprehensive toolkit tailored for
generating raster images from data reported by QuadKeys within [Microsoft's Bing Maps Tile System](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/articles/bing-maps-tile-system). 
Designed to integrate Bing Maps data into R workflows,
this package facilitates the creation of QuadKey grids and raster images
and introduces specialized functions for
the processing of [Facebook Mobility data](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/).


### What are QuadKeys in Tile Maps?

Tile maps divide the Earth's surface into a grid of tiles, with each tile
corresponding to a specific geographic area at various zoom levels. Different 
zoom levels in a tile map display varying levels of detail.

QuadKeys represent a location on a map by encoding its hierarchical
spatial position as a sequence of characters. They provide an efficient method 
to address and retrieve specific map tiles, facilitating rapid display within 
mapping applications such as [Microsoft Bing Maps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/articles/bing-maps-tile-system).

```{r qk, echo = FALSE, out.width= "90%", fig.align='center', fig.cap= "The QuadKey of any tile starts with the QuadKey of its parent tile (the containing tile at the previous level). Image extracted from Microsoft's Bing Maps Tile System webpage."}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/quadkeys.jpg")
```

The goal of `quadkeyr` is to:  
  
1. [**Provide Bing Maps Tile System functions**](https://fernandez-lab-wsu.github.io/quadkeyr/articles/quadkey_conversion.html)
R functions to convert geographical coordinates 
to and from QuadKeys as described in the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/articles/bing-maps-tile-system)  
  
2. [**Create rasters based on QuadKeys**](https://fernandez-lab-wsu.github.io/quadkeyr/articles/get_grid_from_quadkeys.html)
Complete a grid of QuadKeys within a specified area and level of detail, 
and create a raster from them. 
  
3. [**Generate rasters from Facebook mobility data**](https://fernandez-lab-wsu.github.io/quadkeyr/articles/create_rasters_from_grid.html)
Adapt the functions described in points 1 and 2 to effectively process and
analyze Facebook mobility data.  
  
4. Introduce a QuadKey map application enabling users to validate function 
outcomes and offering tools for visualizing the generated data.
