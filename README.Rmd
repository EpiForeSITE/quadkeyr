The `quadkeyr` R package presents a comprehensive toolkit tailored for generating 
raster images from QuadKeys within [Microsoft's Bing Maps Tile System](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/articles/bing-maps-tile-system). 
Designed to integrate Bing Maps data into R workflows, this package facilitates the creation 
of QuadKey grids and rasters and introduces specialized functions for
the processing of [Facebook Mobility data](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/).

---

The goal of `quadkeyr` is to:  
  
1. [**Bing Maps Tile System functions**](https://fernandez-lab-wsu.github.io/quadkeyr/articles/quadkey_conversion.html)
Provide functions in R to convert QuadKeys to coordinates and vice versa, 
as described in the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/articles/bing-maps-tile-system)  
  
2. [**Create rasters based on QuadKeys**](https://fernandez-lab-wsu.github.io/quadkeyr/articles/get_grid_from_quadkeys.html)
Complete a grid of QuadKeys within a specified area and level of detail, 
and create a raster from them. 
  
3. [**Generate rasters from Facebook mobility data**](https://fernandez-lab-wsu.github.io/quadkeyr/articles/create_rasters_from_grid.html)
Adapt the functions described in points 1 and 2 to effectively process and
analyze Facebook mobility data.  
  
4. Introduce a QuadKey map application enabling users to validate function 
outcomes and offering tools for visualizing the generated data.


## Installation

You can install the development version of `quadkeyr` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Fernandez-Lab-WSU/quadkeyr")
```
